Java API and demo programs to control Parrot's [AR.Drone](http://ardrone.parrot.com/).

The goal of the project to have Java API (without using native code) to control AR.Drone. This project does not user Parrot's SDK, but rather implement networking protocols directly in Java.

The code supposed to be cross-platform. We use MacOS X and Linux for development. The library works both on PC/Mac as well as on Android. The demo programs are using GameController.

You can watch a [small video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0CsKlIfquo) of how it works.
The project also includes drone navigation program, written in Java: ControlTower.

Developed by [Codeminders](http://www.codeminders.com/) and contributors.
Patches, bug reports and other help is very welcome.
