<h1>Controller mapping</h1>
You can configure the buttons on the GameController to send commands to the drone or take pictures and videos using the "Controller Mapping" window. Press the "mapping" button next to the controller icon to open it:<br>

<h2>Assigning commands</h2>
On the left you can select the button you want to configure. On the right you can select the command that is being executed. For flight and led animations you can specify further options like duration and frequency.<br>
<br>
You can specify a delay for the command so that when you press the button the command will be sent to the drone after the specified time has passed. This is useful for using multiple commands per button (see below).<br>
<br>
Change the parameters to your liking and press "store" to save the command for this button.<br>
<br>
<h2>Multiple commands per button</h2>
Press the "Next" button after you have configured and stored the first command. The number will show you that you now edit the second command for this button. Configure it and press store again.<br>
<br>
After you store it you can press "Next" again and add a further command if you want, the list will automatically be extended.<br>
<br>
To remove a command from the button, set the command to "None" and store it.
